ok this works with primary screen (urxvt)
but not with git diff
echo $GIT_PAGER
less -+X -R -S -+F -+E

and not withing less/vim which use second screens too(like git diff)

but git diff is slightly different because it doesn't clear the previous screens and thus allows mouse LMB selection drag towards the top but not towards the bottom.
I think the mousewheel patch could maybe address this, or something similar

---------
can't seem to select more than one screen of text with mouse
1. it won't scroll down while holding LMB and going to bottom
(but window border is disabled, if it matters)
2. if already selected, scrolling down past the beginning of selection, deselects the entire selected block!!

crap
