tested speed with this(2014 September 6-7 )

laptop(2012) works well, 13megabytes/sec and likely the same or at least 10 MiB/s when booting

desktop computer however(2009) seems stuck at usb1.1 max speed of 12Mbps which is roughly 1 MiB/sec
takes 26mins +-, to boot manjaro, which gets stuck on manjaro screen after boot screen and can only ctrl+alt+del from there

tested 3 different card readers with ms pro duo 4g card, and basically 11 usb ports

with laptop only tested 1 usb card reader

both laptop and desktop need USB Legacy turned on to be able to boot from it

desktop has usb 2 in bios turned on, but to no avail.
