----------
Don't set AMD C1E Support to Enabled in BIOS, set it on Auto or Disabled or else you see lots of CPU stalling and you have to press keys during boot else it gets stuck! (CPUs sleeping?)
Workaround: set all bios cores to disabled (3 of them; one remains)
Fix: set AMD C1E Support to Disabled!
