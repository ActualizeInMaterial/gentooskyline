hmm, seems to be working with 4.6.0-rc7 so far!
CONFIG_MTRR=y (was set already)
these are new:
CONFIG_MTRR_SANITIZER=y
CONFIG_MTRR_SANITIZER_ENABLE_DEFAULT=0
CONFIG_MTRR_SANITIZER_SPARE_REG_NR_DEFAULT=1
CONFIG_X86_PAT=y

----------
OK DON'T SET PAT !!!! because radeon is giving blackscreens of lockup on startup, right at luks password when it's changing mode, unless radeon.modeset=0 at kernel cmdline  in which case you remain in vga textonly mode and startx aka X won't start! also sysrq won't work! (or numlock, obviously)
sometimes it works, sometimes it locks up; last time I couldn't boot at all - it would always lock up on blackscreen!! so, go away!
---no:
DON'T!!!Note: enabling CONFIG_MTRR and its child option CONFIG_X86_PAT as instructed by drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/radeon_object.c:236:2: warning: #warning Please enable CONFIG_MTRR and CONFIG_X86_PAT for better performance thanks to write-combining [-Wcpp]
