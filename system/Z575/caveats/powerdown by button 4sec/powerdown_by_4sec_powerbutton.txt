on my lenovo z575
when the system cannot be powered down any other way than by 4 seconds holding the power button
then on next startup(power on) the hdds will not be recognized and the POST stalls for a while
workaround is, ctrl+alt+del when you see the post being stalled, and on this next warm boot all will work again!

no need to enter bios, if you do, even if you discard changes, it will try to continue boot and will try from network card
and on next ctrl+alt+del that you do, you have to enter bios again to reorder the boot devices!

but if you do not enter bios at all, (and also don't allow it to boot when stalled POST) then ctrl+alt+del and will work all well, no need to reorder boot sequence again
