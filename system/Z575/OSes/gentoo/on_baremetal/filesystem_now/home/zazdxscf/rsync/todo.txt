put these msgs:

changed ownership of /home/emacs/gentooskyline/system/Z575/OSes/gentoo/filesystem_now/gentoo from root to 1000

inside a file, stored on git, add a script nearby which could restore these ...


in other words, have scripts that use rsync  auto apply the perms(so rsync can use the real-world perms), and scripts that use git auto remove the perms(so git can access all files)

instead of how it is now, copying the rsync dir (./gentoo/ from here) into the git location and then resetting perms there to relax them for git to read

--------
allow sudo to not exist and work ok if already root; fail if not root!
