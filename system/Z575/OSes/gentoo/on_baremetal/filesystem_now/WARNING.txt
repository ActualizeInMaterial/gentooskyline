Do not put or update any files inside ./gentoo/ because they are being overwritten when running the script:
4copytogit
and in fact the entire folder is removed before that script is copying the new one!! so any new files there are lost!

so, DO NOT touch anything in ./gentoo/ ! it gets wiped on each invocation of 4copytogit script.
