all this is done to test that patchRSB can be applied on top of patchISBS
without hunks failed!
also tests patchRSB on top of origKS (but this is where the patch came from in the first place though)

patchRSB= that enables remembering each console scrollbuffer
patchISBS= patch that increases max scrollbuffer size from 1024 to 4096

folder a contains original kernel sources 3.16-rc7 currently aka origKS
folder b contains patched sources with only the patchRSB (so it doesn't contain patchISBS)

folder 2 contains only the *.orig files which ./testpatch must know of in order to restore them before applying the patchRSB to them
these *.orig files are patchISBS applied on top of origKS

folder 3 contains origKS but with filenames having an additional .orig extension
they are used as source for testing the patchRSB against origKS, to see if it can be applied successfuly

folder c contains patchISBS applied on origKS

all above folders should have directory structure preserved

put vgacon.c and Kconfig in current folder to have it copied into b/drivers/video/console/vgacon.c.orig ...
so it's more automated this way
this vgacon.c should be origKS patched with patchRSB
