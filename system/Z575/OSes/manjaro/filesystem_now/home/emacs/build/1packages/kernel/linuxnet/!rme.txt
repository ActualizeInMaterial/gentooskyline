needs pacman-git

pacman -S xmlto docbook-xsl

============
0. maybe modify PKGBUILD to get next version
1. run ./justextractandprep
2. see if needed to update sha512sum for .sign or other (new)files, and you get the sha512sum by checking sign files with: cd into sources folder then run:
./signcheck.bash linux-3.16.tar.sign_ 
for example.
then edit the appropriate sha512sums entry in PKGBUILD (order matters)

3. diffconfigs config.x86_64 .config
see what options are new and need rechecking

4. ./updatekernel
to install in grub
or just ./recompile
to recompile
