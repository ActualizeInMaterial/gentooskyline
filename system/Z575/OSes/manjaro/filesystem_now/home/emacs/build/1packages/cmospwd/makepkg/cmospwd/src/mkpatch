Patch for getting the right user/supervisor passwords for BIOS:
Award Modular BIOS v6.00PG
bios version: F8n
found on motherboard GIGABYTE GA-MA790FXT-UD5P
01/07/2011-RD790-SB750-....

trivially found(thanks to the existing code) a while ago by EmanueL Czirai when I forgot my passwords

the code in this patch was originally made for DOS with bcc.exe compiler, I think. Those definitions may be useless for Linux.
