make sure you have created an environment first by using
cd openwrt
./scripts/env new somenamehere

and THEN you can use the contents of ./openwrt/ from this git

-----------
THEN, apply the *.patch  manually! (if they aren't already in effect due to new commits having them made obsolete)

eg. cd ./openwrt && patch -Np1 -i /home/emacs/build/router/openwrt/source/env_diff_params_pass.patch

-----------
NOTE: need to set CONFIG_LOCALMIRROR="file:///home/emacs/build/router/openwrt/mirror"  
      ... ONLY AFTER ./go because ./go downloads(in the process of compiling) all packages needed into ./openwrt/dl/ folder! The "dl/" folder which is inside openwrt folder(which in turn has the openwrt repo inside)
----------
Note: the docs inside git are outdated(last commit log 2012) compared to the wiki(last update 2013)
for the docs, in Manjaro/Arch Linux, you need:
sudo pacman -S latex2html
^ that has pdflatex and latex  commands

for htlatex command get:
sudo pacman -S texlive-htmlxml

now you can cd ./openwrt/docs && make
well, do ./go instead!

how to use diffconfig

copy/pasted:
Configure using config diff file

Beside make menuconfig another way to configure is using a configuration diff file. This file includes only the changes compared to the default configuration. A benefit is that this file can be version controlled with your OpenWRT based project. It's also less affected by OpenWRT updates, because it only contains the changes.

Creating diff file

This file is created using the <buildroot dir>/scripts/diffconfig.sh script.

Using diff file

These changes can form the basis of a config file (<buildroot dir>/.config). By running make defconfig these changes will be expanded into a full config.

cat diffconfig > .config # append changes to bottom of .config
make defconfig # expand to full config
These changes can also be added to the bottom of the config file (<buildroot dir>/.config), by running make defconfig these changes will override the existing configuration.

cat diffconfig >> .config # append changes to bottom of .config
make defconfig # apply changes
