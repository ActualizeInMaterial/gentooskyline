------
Reproduce:
1. the only enabled extension should be: HTML5 video for YouTube™ 0.5.11
2. load this unlisted youtube video in a tab: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVKkW-UhLuM
3. chromium crashed with:

[11664:11693:0806/210113:FATAL:url_request.cc(706)] Trying to send secure referrer for insecure load
Aborted

Chromium Version 38.0.2107.2 (286086) (64-bit)
Linux manji 3.16.0-rc7-MANJAROed SMP Sat Aug 2 21:37:56 CEST 2014 x86_64 GNU/Linux
all chromium plugins are disabled (there's no flash anyway)

Fix: disable extension: HTML5 video for YouTube™ 0.5.11
step 2 doesn't crash now.

Maybe this happens only with unlisted youtube videos?
