solved:
/usr/lib/modules-load.d/nfs-utils.conf
with contents:
nfs

exists because packages nfs-utils is installed
so: pacman -Rs nfs-utils

also mentioned this here: https://github.com/manjaro/packages-community/issues/2
as a side note.
------
there's no trace of nfs to be loaded and yet this tries to load it:
Jul 08 19:41:35 manji systemd-modules-load[7172]: Failed to find module 'nfs'
