----
now the problem is that dkms runs after system-load-modules and there doesn't seem to be a way to fix it (but I don't know enough of systemd at the moment)

--------------old:
prevents systemd-modules-load from starting
if I put a Before line in dkms.service
$ sudo vim /usr/lib/systemd/system/dkms.service

so looks like this:
[Unit]
Description=Dynamic Kernel Modules System
Before=systemd-modules-load.service

[Service]
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=no
ExecStart=/usr/lib/systemd/scripts/dkms start
ExecStop=/usr/lib/systemd/scripts/dkms stop

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target


btw, this was already done after the change:
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload

so the statuses after reboot look like this:

$ systemctl status systemd-modules-load
● systemd-modules-load.service - Load Kernel Modules
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-modules-load.service; static)
   Active: inactive (dead)
     Docs: man:systemd-modules-load.service(8)
           man:modules-load.d(5)

[emacs@manji ~]$ systemctl status dkms
● dkms.service - Dynamic Kernel Modules System

===============
[   45.082502] systemd[1]: Found dependency on systemd-modules-load.service/start
[   45.105077] systemd[1]: Found dependency on systemd-modules-load.service/start

[   45.134686] systemd[1]: Job systemd-modules-load.service/start deleted to break ordering cycle starting with basic.target/start

so that's why it doesn't start...
ok, it was because I had modified systemd-modules-load.service which lives here:
$ sudo vim /usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-modules-load.service
and had put dkms.service as a dependency here:
After=systemd-readahead-collect.service systemd-readahead-replay.service
(unseen now, 'cause fixed it)

now the statuses are like this (because nfs module wasn't found):
$ systemctl status systemd-modules-load
● systemd-modules-load.service - Load Kernel Modules
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-modules-load.service; static)
   Active: failed (Result: exit-code) since Wed 2014-07-09 02:14:55 CEST; 4min 44s ago
     Docs: man:systemd-modules-load.service(8)
           man:modules-load.d(5)
  Process: 1638 ExecStart=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-modules-load (code=exited, status=1/FAILURE)

$ systemctl status dkms
● dkms.service - Dynamic Kernel Modules System
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/dkms.service; enabled)
   Active: active (exited) since Wed 2014-07-09 02:14:58 CEST; 5min ago

 Main PID: 2416 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
   CGroup: /system.slice/dkms.service

as you can see from the date/time (not from "ago" because i waited between commands)
dkms was executed last!
