Jul 08 19:10:41 manji systemd[1]: Reloading.
Jul 08 19:10:41 manji systemd[1]: Failed to open /dev/autofs: No such file or directory
Jul 08 19:10:41 manji systemd[1]: Failed to reload: No such file or directory


so, looks like "/dev/autofs" is hardcoded in the systemd binary, does systemd depend on kernel automounter being build inside the kernel?

Linux manji 3.15.4-1-MANJARO #8 SMP PREEMPT Tue Jul 8 18:41:32 CEST 2014 x86_64 GNU/Linux

https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/autofs4-mount-control.txt

made gist here: (nolonger exists online)
============== from gist:
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
 
somewhere in
$ sudo journalctl -b 0
...
Jul 08 19:10:41 manji systemd[1]: Reloading.
Jul 08 19:10:41 manji systemd[1]: Failed to open /dev/autofs: No such file or directory
Jul 08 19:10:41 manji systemd[1]: Failed to reload: No such file or directory
...
 
hmm but then later on (don't know what I did in between):
...
Jul 08 19:40:30 manji systemd[1]: Reloading.
...
 
and no more fails
 
I wonder why it failed in the first place
 
Linux manji 3.15.4-1-MANJARO #8 SMP PREEMPT Tue Jul 8 18:41:32 CEST 2014 x86_64 GNU/Linux
 
well, found more info in dmesg (shouldn't this already be in journalctl? it isn't:
$ sudo journalctl -b 0 |grep -i autofs
[sudo] password for emacs:
Jul 08 19:10:41 manji systemd[1]: Failed to open /dev/autofs: No such file or directory
) :
so dmesg:
...
