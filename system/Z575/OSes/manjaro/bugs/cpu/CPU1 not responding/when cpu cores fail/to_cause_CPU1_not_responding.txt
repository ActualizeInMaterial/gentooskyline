it will always CPU1 not responding, probably while the mouse initializes...

CPU1 Not Responding if wireless mouse is turned on, before boot

While at the GRUB menu before boot, I turn on my wireless mouse(*1) then press Enter immediately to boot. The kernel waits for about 5 seconds at the message "Loading ramdisk..." then continues booting. However only 3 cores are up, and CPU1 is not. The dmesg looks like this:

[    0.174715] x86: Booting SMP configuration:
[    0.174719] .... node  #0, CPUs:      #1

(*1) the wireless mouse is a Genius 2.4G Wireless BlueEye Mouse (Genius DX-ECO and it seems to take about 3 seconds to initialize when turning it on by the switch underneath it: when turned on, the led on top of it shines red for about 2-3 seconds, however when testing this on the desktop, the mouse pointer will move right from the start (no need to wait 2-3 seconds until the light from the led stops)
[    8.440514] device: 'input8': device_add

[   30.063526] input input8: event field not found
The last line always happens first time (and only once) when moving the mouse. And if I wait until desktop is ready and move it then, it causes the equivalent of a right click on the desktop which brings up that specific menu. This may be irrelevant here.
