probably only in manjaro/arch

need to check why this happens:
echo "begin$(tput smul)test$(tput rmbash: command substitution: line 5: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `"'
bash: command substitution: line 6: syntax error: unexpected end of file
bash: command substitution: line 5: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `"'
bash: command substitution: line 6: syntax error: unexpected end of file


basically the command is:
echo "begin$(tput smul)test$(tput rm"
and then you press tab key and that error happens!
the cursor must be after rm  or after " it also happens with:
echo "begin$(tput smul)test$(tput rm"bash: command substitution: line 5: unexpected EOF while looking for matching `"'
