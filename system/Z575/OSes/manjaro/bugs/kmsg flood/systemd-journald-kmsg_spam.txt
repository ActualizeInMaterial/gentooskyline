systemd-journald will spam dmesg logs that /dev/kmsg is buffer is overrun...
and while framebuffer is on this will make the system unresponsive due to slow scrolling up


looks like this happens even without framebuffer, however it seems to me that i am able to ctrl+alt+del from this


the spam/flood happens only when:
Device Drivers  --->  
	-*- Power supply class support  ---> 
		[*]   Power supply debug
is set
aka CONFIG_POWER_SUPPLY_DEBUG

and I'm using this kernel cmdline:
in grub:
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="ipv6.disable=1 pnp.debug=1 loglevel=7 log_buf_len=5110M printk.always_kmsg_dump=y printk.time=y nofb mminit_loglevel=0"


$ cat /proc/cmdline 
BOOT_IMAGE=/vmlinuz-315-x86_64 root=UUID=bfa4ab6e-19a3-4601-ba2b-267c55841c73 rw cryptdevice=/dev/disk/by-uuid/70c08890-417a-497d-b6ab-c0d0357a63e2:cryptManjaro:allow-discards ipv6.disable=1 pnp.debug=1 loglevel=7 log_buf_len=5110M printk.always_kmsg_dump=y printk.time=y nofb mminit_loglevel=0
