with the included .config

it will cause a general protection fault (see picture)
-----
if I disable vboxdrv and co. to load, by systemctl disable dkms
then the error is a panic dump or something, can't scroll up or use sysrq key in either case
---

looks like, I have to either disable dkms  (systemctl status dkms    ; use disable instead of status here)

or just remove the vbox drivers i mean modules from dkms with:
sudo dkms remove vboxhost/4.3.12 --all

--all means do it for all kernels, though, I should probably use -k and specify only the kernel that's oopsing aka 4.3.15

but if I don't wanna use --all then i can use uninstall instead of remove and just pass the relevant -k for the kernel i want to uninstall them from
---------

wtf it didn't fail again hmmm... i think the dkms stuff doesn't know when to recompile the module?
and maybe it used the old version? even tho i updated the kernel slightly
---
soooooo
looks like the problem is leftover modules from fglrx and more importantly vboxhost aka vboxdrv and co.
basically dkms isn't doing its job of triggering the build for vboxhost which rebuild vboxdrv and co. modules for the current(or specified) kernel

so need to find a way to tell dkms to compile vboxdrv (& co.) whenever I've updated the kernel, the same kernel version,which doesn't change, maybe that's the problem.
---
so, i'm modifying dkms to consider when kernel version(not release) gets changed
version is uname -v
release is uname -r
