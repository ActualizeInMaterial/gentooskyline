updates are in reverse order ie. read file from bottom to top, if you want to get it in updates-order

so, compiling 3.12.24 kernel
to get to see why it works with it
it's actually kernel 3.12.23 'cause i didn't update my git repo with the PKGBUILD

----
so I don't get it :) why does it happen?
then I guess: `user space fb is a must` is not true!
----------
wait a second! just as I suspected, I changed something else in kernel and rebooted and it blankscreen-locked again, then turned off power booted again and it worked this time-- 
soooo, it may be something that happens only on reboot, or only on reboot after kernel got updated?
hmm odd
hmm just plain rebooting after being in X doesn't seem to crash it
let's try parole play a video a bit then rebooting, which is what I did before
yep that is the one, if I ran parole, then closed it then rebooted, it blank-froze when switching to fb (from text console!)

now let's see if that happens if I don't change to next video in playlist (which when done causes some kind of fullscreen or fullsourcevideo resolution then minimize to normal window size before playing it)
wtf that worked this time, hmm

let's retry with switching to next video but without seeking into it
that also worked
let's try resizing also now: worked again!
ok last thing was also seeking into the video!
also worked.

so I don't get it:) why did it blank ? hmmm

spend more time before restart?

------------
when using framebuffer
and
CONFIG_FB_RADEON is Y (not M)
then CONFIG_FB_UVESA  must also be Y (probably not M, not tested tho)
or else black blank screen and system locks up when switching from textmode console to framebuffer, before root fs gets mounted, because it's in kernel(that Y)
======== totally removed CONFIG_FB_UVESA and it works without it btw! just sometimes it crashes with blank screen and it seems to be after dkms compiles vboxdrv and related, on the next reboot!
