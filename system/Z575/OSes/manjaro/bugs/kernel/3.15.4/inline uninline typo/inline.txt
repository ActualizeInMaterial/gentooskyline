 ││ This option determines if the kernel forces gcc to inline the functions  ││
 ││ developers have marked 'inline'. Doing so takes away freedom from gcc to ││
 ││ do what it thinks is best, which is desirable for the gcc 3.x series of  ││
 ││ compilers. The gcc 4.x series have a rewritten inlining algorithm and    ││
 ││ enabling this option will generate a smaller kernel there. Hopefully     ││
 ││ this algorithm is so good that allowing gcc 4.x and above to make the    ││
 ││ decision will become the default in the future. Until then this option   ││
 ││ is there to test gcc for this.                                           ││
