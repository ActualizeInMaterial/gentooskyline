while viewing any (text?) file
press End (or press PageDown until you reach the end)
now pressing PageDown again should do nothing, but it scrolls the text up by 1 line on each press until top of the last line is the first line then stops.

DownArrow key acts the same as PageDown key - when at end of file (press End)
