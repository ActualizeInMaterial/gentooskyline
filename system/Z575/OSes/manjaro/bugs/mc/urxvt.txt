mc + urxvt
and my keypad keys: only these 3: +-*
run mc
press + on keypad
notice it works
turn on numlock
press + again, notice it works
turn off numlock
type: ls
press enter
return from terminal by pressing enter again
now pressing +
gets stuck does nothing and it will eat the next 20 chars
say type: a
20 times
and the 21st one is shown

if i keep pressing only +-* (of the numpad) I keep getting like 1 character per 2 seconds like these: mmkjmkjjjmkjmmkjkkjm

to fix:
temporary fix: turn on numlock
[the keys work regardless of numlock state(when they work normally)]
less temporary fix: restart mc

permanent fix: unknown?

another temporary fix is to press enter after returning from shell, which makes +-* work again!
also look in sourcecode for:
 /*
   * use Num_Lock to toggle Keypad on/off.  If Num_Lock is off, allow an
   * escape sequence to toggle the Keypad.
   *
   * Always permit `shift' to override the current setting
   */
in command.C
maybe there's something there related to that which causes this!


also, this issue definitely doesn't happen with xfce4-terminal
