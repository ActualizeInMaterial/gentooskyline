using Alt+S
"\es":forward-search-history
instead of Ctrl+S or a manual Ctrl+Y for example

doesn't work the same
the Alt+S variant clears the searched string, so it's useless to go forward


I use Ctrl+Y  in /etc/inputrc
"\C-y": forward-search-history

in case you were wondering Ctrl+Alt+R exits search instead of acting like an Alt+R for reverse-i-search would do if it were bound to Alt+R instead of Ctrl+R


but of course some upgrade overwrote /etc/inputrc !!!
must use ~/.inputrc
