so i have a shortcut:
chromium modified cmdline.desktop
and I rename it to:
OLDchromium modified cmdline.desktop
but it doesn't show the new name, still the original name is shown on desktop
F5 does refresh the desktop but the name remains
===
hmm logout doesn't refresh either, and it's restarting X basically
must be that the name is contained within the *.desktop file however there's no way to edit it
==
oh wait there's right click and Edit Launcher  and there the name can be edited!
so F2 or right-click and Rename only edits the filename which is not visible while the icon is on desktop
