apparently both left and right clicks act as if they're being held down
because the menu appears(due to right click)
and then left click seems held due to moving mouse causes selection in the filemanager (now pcmanfm)

---------

moving mouse Genius Wireless BlueEye on the desktop first time after boot
causes a right click (the menu just appears)
also this on dmesg:
$ dmesg|grep -i input8
[    2.966636] device: 'input8': device_add
