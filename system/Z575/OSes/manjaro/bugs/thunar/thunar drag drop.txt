drag and dropping in thunar doesn't work anymore
reason: unknown!

sometimes even the + sign doesn't appear when dragging

----NO---
looks like it has something to do with the
length of the path
dest:
/home/emacs/texts/workflowy/additions/manjaro/bugs/thunar drag drop doesnt work/
nope that's not it!! NOOOOOOOO
-------------


so it seems to be something related to being autostarted by X due to having saved the session

but trying to move a file from the broken window to the source window that works!
but not the normal way: from src to dest window
