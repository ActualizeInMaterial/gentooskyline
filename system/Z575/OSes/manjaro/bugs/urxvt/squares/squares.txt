a bunch of squares appearing while doing right click selecting randomly on this line:

cd "/home/emacs/Music"&& mp3 Katy\ Perry\ -\ Dark\ Horse\ \(Official\)\ ft.\ Jui

the selection need not be more than this line though


can be reproduced by right clicking on lines on an empty background (spaces)
basically just rightclick on the bottom then somewhere above and keep rightclicking while changing lines, and the issue happens

there must be empty line (of spaces?) on the last selected line, apparently
so just try this on an empty area for best results
