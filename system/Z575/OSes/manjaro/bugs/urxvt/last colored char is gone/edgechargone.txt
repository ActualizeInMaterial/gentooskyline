reproduce anywhere:
for i in $(seq $(tput cols)); do echo -n a;done|grep --color=always a

reproduce on my comp:
ip addr|grep -i net0|grep -i UP 
2: net0: <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP> mtu 1500 qdisc htb state DOWN grou  default qlen 1000

notice "group" at the end has a missing "p"
resizing or copy pasting that has no effect, that p is definitely gone!
