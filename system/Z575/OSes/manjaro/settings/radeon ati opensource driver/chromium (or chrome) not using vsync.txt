if you see no vsync in chromium (or chrome) but you see it everywhere else
for example there's tearing mostly seen in youtube videos
eg. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laDA1NOn-C4

then 

chrome://flags

and click Enable on this one:
Override software rendering list Mac, Windows, Linux, Chrome OS, Android
Overrides the built-in software rendering list and enables GPU-acceleration on unsupported system configurations. #ignore-gpu-blacklist
Disable


also made a note of it here: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Talk:Chromium
