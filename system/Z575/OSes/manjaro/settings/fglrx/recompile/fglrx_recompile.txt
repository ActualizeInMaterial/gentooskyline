=============================
--- to make fglrx driver work with new kerneli(3.15.3, whereas old one is 3.12.22...):

make sure the header files for current(old!) kernel are installed:
sudo pacman -S linux312-headers

after you set up the new kernel, but while still in the old kernel:
use yaourt to install catalyst-hook from AUR on manjaro

this will ensure that fglrx is recompiled when needed

it may work to install it while in the new kernel but it will need a reboot i guess, haven't tried!


catalyst-hook needs the headers to be in this folder:
/usr/lib/modules/3.12.22-1-MANJARO/build/
which they will be after they're installed above with this cmd:
sudo pacman -S linux312-headers

and the new kernel will have them also in it's own build dir, currently:
/usr/lib/modules/3.15.3-1-MANJARO/build/

NOW, to rebuild fglrx module run:
sudo /usr/bin/catalyst_build_module
that is, if you are in the old kernel and you didn't already have the linux headers
otherwise, if u had them, no need! you can check in catalyst or run parole
if work, u have it good! if it doesn't work, u can modprobe fglrx but u need to restart X -> this tested to work!
