these 2 logs are with radeon DDX FOSS driver, not with fglrx
--
the .old one was startx and logout from xfce4 menu because xfwm4 apparently didn't get started (for unknown reasons, this happens)
then the .log is when it worked, however there are no diff between the two (relevant to this) - so must be something else
