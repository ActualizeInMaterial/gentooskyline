this patch is done against the Manjaro distro version of dkms which is 
the same version as the archlinux one, from the same location:
the same package is used on both distros:
https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/dkms/

Manjaro distro is based on Arch Linux


it is very likely that the same patch would work for Arch Linux too, 
even though I've tested this on Manjaro only
