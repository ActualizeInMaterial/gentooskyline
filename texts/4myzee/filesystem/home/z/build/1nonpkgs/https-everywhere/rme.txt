----
in Manjaro(Arch linux):
required for ./go

sudo pacman -S python2-lxml

----
for running
bash test.sh
you'll need(in gentoo):

time emerge -nav dev-python/selenium lxml pycurl regex dev-util/bsdiff dev-python/python-levenshtein


well, bash test.sh won't work because it needs chromium and something like
firefox addon sdk(?) which I don't have (and git submodule update won't do
anything)
