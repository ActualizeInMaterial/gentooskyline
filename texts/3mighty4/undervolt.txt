T400 undervolting:

might need Windows:
- get Orthos to test if stable! (Go - ORTHOS BETA by Johnny Lee)
"The really nice thing about using ORTHOS to stress test your cpu is that you really don't need to worry that much about getting a BSOD because ORTHOS will detect a hardware failure and halt the test."

- get rmclock or a least cpu usage one: ThrottleStop
(see the comment above the one pointed by "src:" ^ above)
//- also see:
//"You guys might be interested in trying NHC, notebook hardware control. It allows for voltages as low as 0.7v. One thing though: it doesn't support as many notebooks as RMClock, so your lappy might not be supported. I used to run .7v on a 1.86Ghz Sonoma @ 800Mhz."

NHC can only do 32 bit! ignore it!

yeah I can't undervolt this under Windows! the programs seem to be reporting
unreliable/variable voltages (vids/fids) such as rmclock...
so, temporarily gave up on this, maybe I'll try under linux
