WHAT THIS PACKAGE DOES

This utility will examine your system configuration and detect all 2.5 inch SATA
Hard Drives (HDD) installed in your ThinkPad.
SATA (Serial AT Attachment) is a new interface for storage devices.

The utility will then check the firmware revision of the hard drive and judge
whether your system requires a firmware update or not.  If required, it will
prompt you to run the appropriate firmware update program for your drive.

This package is compiled into an ISO format, which is compatible with CD writing
software such which supports and ISO format image file, and writable to a CD-R
or a CD-RW disc.

A written CD-R or CD-RW disc will be bootable.  It will boot from your ThinkPad
Optical Disc Drive(*) and run the update utility program.
  * Your ThinkPad may need to change the boot device setting to boot from an
    Optical Disc Drive. (See the "Prepare boot device" section in this document)

Note: This firmware update utility may not update a drive without a Lenvo part
      number(P/N), even its model is identical to a drive in the supported drive
      list.
      The drives with Lenovo part numbers include firmwares designed for using
      with the ThinkPad system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT INFORMATION

  Note: ThinkPad T431, T440, T440s, T440p, T540p, T450, T450s, L440, L540, L450
        ThinkPad W540, W541, X230s, X240, X240s, X250, S531, S540
        ThinkPad E440, E540
        SATA HDD configuration should be `AHCI'.  Change SATA HDD in BIOS
        Setup/Config before update a firmware.

  Note: The utility will not update an HDD installed in the Ultrabay using the
        Ultrabay HDD adapter.

  Note: ThinkPad W700, W700ds, W701, W701ds
        SATA HDD configuration should be `Compatible'.  Change SATA HDD
        in BIOS Setup/Config before update a firmware.
        Also note that restore this configuration after update, or an
        operating system won't start up and blue screen error may come up.

  Note: ThinkPad W700, W700ds, W701, W701ds
        The SATA Hard Drive Firmware Update Utility won't update a hard
        drive in the W700 Ultrabay with an adapter.
        Hard drives being updated firmwares should be in HDD0 or HDD1 bay

  Note: A bootable CD type is changed from the floppy disc emulation to the
        hard disk emulation from FWSH20 release. Any file viewer software can
        not show the contents of the written CD-R/CD-RW disc.

  Note: The firmware update CD will not boot with UEFI mode. In case of this,
        change ThinkPad Setup/Startup, set "Both" in UEFI/Legacy Boot section
        and "Legacy First" in UEFI/Legacy Boot Priority section or "Legacy Only"
        in UEFI/Legacy Boot section.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE

MAKING A CD-R OR CD-RW DISC TO USE

This section provides instructions  for using RecordNow! to make a bootable CD.
Please refer to a product manual when using other CD writing programs.

  1. Make sure you have a ThinkPad with a CD-RW, DVD/CD-RW combo or DVD multi
     drive installed.  Prepare a blank CD-R or CD-RW disc.
  2. Start Windows Vista, XP, 2000 and logon with administrative privileges.
  3. Download the firmware update utility .ISO file.
  4. Run a CD writing software.
  5. Choose the downloaded ISO file in step 3 of this process to create
     your CD.
  6. Follow the instructions on the screen.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PREPARE THE BOOT DEVICE

The resulting CD-R or CD-RW disc includes an operating system and is bootable on
the supported ThinkPad models.

Note:
  The Hard Drive Firmware Update Utility bootable CD does not support
  USB Optical Disc Drives, PCMCIA/CardBUS Optical Disc Drives, Optical Disc
  Drives in a Docking Station bay, or any other drives other than the Optical Disc
  Drive in the ThinkPad UltraBay.  Other drives will not be updated correctly
  by this firmware update utility.

Please confirm that an Optical Disc Drive is in the boot device list of your BIOS setup.
  1. Power off the ThinkPad, if it is turned on.
  2. Power on the ThinkPad.
  3. Press the F1 key to enter the BIOS Setup Utility when the "ThinkPad" logo is
     seen on the screen.
  4. Choose "Startup" from the menu
  5. Choose "Boot" from the menu(*)
  6. In "Boot Priority Order", set "ATAPI CD0" to the top of the list, "1".
  7. Press F10 to save the new setup.
  8. Power off or restart the system.

*Note: Please write down the current boot priority order for restoration
        later if you need to modify your boot list.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION GUIDE

After the above sections "Making a CD-R or CD-RW disc to use" and
"Prepare the boot device" have been completed, follow these steps.
Please connect the AC adapter and use a fully charged battery to power the
ThinkPad system during the update.  This will avoid an accidental loss of power.

Important Notice: Please remove the hard drive password. Otherwise the
                  firmware can't be updated and an error message will be displayed.

Note: Install only one Hard Drive into your ThinkPad.

1. Place the CD-R or CD-RW disc you created in "Making a CD-R or CD-RW disc to use"
   section into your ThinkPad Optical Disc Drive.
2. Boot the system with the Firmware Update Utility.
3. Drives that have been detected will be listed in the upper area of the Main Menu.
   If a drive that requires an update is detected, it will be shown with a blinking
   mark on the left.  If you find no blinking mark, your Hard Drive has the
   latest firmware and there is no need to update or the update firmware is not valid
   for your drive.  Remove the Firmware Update Utility and shutdown your ThinkPad.
4. Follow the instructions on the screen to update the necessary drives.
5. When the installation is complete, remove the Firmware Update Utility CD or CD-RW
   from the Optical Disc Drive and power off your ThinkPad system.
   Do not restart the ThinkPad system with the Ctrl-Alt-Delete keys.
6. Enter the BIOS Setup Utility again, if you need to restore your original boot order
   and/or a hard drive password.

Attention: Please do not power off the ThinkPad during the firmware update,
            or your Hard Drive may NOT be usable anymore.

 Notes:
 - The update utility will not find a Hard Drive in a Docking Station
   In this case, please remove the drive and install it into a Hard Drive bay
   in your ThinkPad.
   If you encounter a problem installing a Hard Drive into your
   ThinkPad, please call your local Help Center.
 - The utility contains several executable files, but DO NOT RUN THESE PROGRAMS.
   Running these programs manually could ruin your drive.
 - The Hard Drive Firmware Update Utility does not support a
   suspend/hibernation/resume feature of the ThinkPad while the firmware update
   utility is running.  Please do not use Fn-F4 or equivalent functions.
