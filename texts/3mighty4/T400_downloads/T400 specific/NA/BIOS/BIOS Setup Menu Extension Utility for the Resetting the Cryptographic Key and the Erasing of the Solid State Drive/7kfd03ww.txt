--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT THIS PACKAGE DOES

  This package enables new menus, 'Disk Encryption HDD' and 'Solid
  State Drive', in the BIOS Setup Utility.

  This will work with FDE feature supported hard disk drives.
  Refer to marketing materials to find out what ThinkPad models
  support which devices.


  Disk Encryption HDD menu:

  This is the feature to reset a cryptographic key of the harddisk
  drive (HDD) with Full Disk Encryption (FDE) function.

  The FDE make encryption to writing data to its disk and decryption
  for reading out from a disk. Without a same cryptographic key in an
  HDD, the data inside can not be read properly decoded.
  Once a new key is defined by reset, the previous key is deleted from
  the HDD and then the read and write operations are done with using
  the new key. This means the computer can not be booted from the HDD
  nor read data in the HDD after resetting a cryptographic key.

  The HDD itself makes a cryptographic key and manages it, but the
  ThinkPad computer does not store any cryptographic key information.
  Once a new cryptographic key is defined by doing the Resetting the
  Cryptographic Key, as there is no way to restore the previous key,
  recovery of the HDD data is impossible.


  Solid State Drive menu:

  This is the feature to erase all contents of the Solid State Drive
  in a minute.


  Make sure to use these features.

  If this package has been installed, updating (overwrite-installing)
  this package will fix problems, add new functions, or expand
  functions as noted below.

  This program is language independent and can be used with any
  language system.

CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE
  Version 1.01

[Important updates]
  Nothing.

[New functions or enhancements]
- Added the Bootable ISO type DOS included.
- Update support models (actual program code is same as 1.01)

[Problem fixes]
  Nothing.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DETERMINING WHICH VERSION IS INSTALLED

  Run DRVMENU.EXE with no parameter. Version information is displayed
  on the screen.
  Refer to the "Using the Resetting the Cryptographic Key" section for
  the details.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTES

- After the Resetting the Cryptographic Key of FDE is done, you cannot
  boot your computer from the HDD nor read data in the HDD. The HDD
  itself makes a cryptographic key and manages it, but the ThinkPad
  computer does not store any cryptographic key information.
  Once a new cryptographic key is defined by doing the Resetting the
  Cryptographic Key, as there is no way to restore the previous key,
  recovery of the HDD data is impossible.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

Note:
  If your computer runs satisfactorily now, it may not be necessary to
  update the software. To determine if you should update the software,
  refer to the Version Information section.


Manual Install

Floppy
  1. Prepare a DOS bootable floppy disk and a floppy disk drive.
  2. Unzip 7KFD03WW.ZIP file and extract DRVMENU.EXE file.
  3. Copy the DRVMENU.EXE to the floppy disk.
  4. Attach the floppy disk drive to the ThinkPad computer, and insert
