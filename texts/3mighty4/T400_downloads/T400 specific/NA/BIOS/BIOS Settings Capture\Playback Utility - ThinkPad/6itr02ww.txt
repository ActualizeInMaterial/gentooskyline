                   ThinkPad Reserve Edition

Operating System   DOS

Version            4.01

Old package name   ThinkPad Remote CMOS Update Utility


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT THIS PACKAGE DOES

  ThinkPad stores various BIOS settings in its nonvolatile memory like CMOS or
  EEPROM. These settings are configured by using the BIOS setup menu. In general,
  this is done manually by the user. However, from a deployment point of view,
  the BIOS settings are expected to be common to all machines and to be
  controlled remotely.
  This software is a DOS application for this purpose.

  Features:
  - Copy BIOS setup data settings
  - Copy BIOS secure data settings
  - Install and update for power-on password
  - Install for hard disk password
  - Copy supervisor password.

  To use this software, a bootable and read/write-able media (floppy disk, USB
  memory, CD-RW, etc.) with DOS or Windows 95/98 boot disk installed, and also
  a device for the media (floppy disk drive, USB port, CD-RW drive, etc.) are
  necessary.

  If this software has been used, updating this software will fix problems, add
  new functions, or expand functions as noted below.

  This program is language independent and can be used with any language system.

  with DOS or Windows 95/98 boot disk installed, and also a device for the media
  (floppy disk drive, USB port, CD-RW drive,  etc.) are necessary.
Å|If you need to deploy the BIOS settings file to all ThinkPad computers through
  IBM RDM (Remote Deployment Manager), refer to the "How to use the software
  with RDM" section.


Capturing BIOS Settings
-----------------------

  Do the following procedures at a donor ThinkPad:

  (Setting up a donor ThinkPad)
  1. Turn off the computer.
  2. Turn on the computer.
  3. While an either of the following messages is displayed at the lower-left
     area of the screen, press the F1 key.
       To interrupt normal startup, press the blue ThinkVantage button
       To interrupt normal startup, press the blue Access IBM button
       Press F1 for BIOS Setup Utility
     The BIOS Setup Utility menu will be displayed. If a password prompt appears,
     type the correct password.
  4. Change and save the desired settings as required.
  5. Exit from the BIOS Setup Utility and restart the computer.
  6. Ensure that the donor ThinkPad starts up and functions properly.

  (Starting capture)
  7. Copy SRCMOS.EXE into a bootable and read/write-able media with DOS or
     Windows 95/98 boot disk installed.
  8. Insert the media in its device, then power on and boot the computer with
     the media.
  9. When the logo screen appears, press the Esc key. The screen mode will
     change to the text mode.
     Note: This step is not required for the following systems:
             ThinkPad R400
             ThinkPad R500
             ThinkPad T400, T400s, T410, T410s
             ThinkPad T410i, T410si
             ThinkPad T500, T510, T510i
             ThinkPad W500, W510
             ThinkPad W700, W700ds, W701, W701ds
             ThinkPad X200, X200s, X200 Tablet
             ThinkPad X201, X201i, X201s, X201 Tablet
             ThinkPad X300, X301
             ThinkPad G50
             ThinkPad R60, R60e, R61, R61e
             ThinkPad T60, T60p, T61, T61p
             ThinkPad X60, X60s, X60 Tablet, X61, X61s, X61 Tablet
             ThinkPad Z61e, Z61m, Z61p, Z61t
             ThinkPad Reserve Edition
 10. At the command line, execute SRCMOS.EXE with the /c option.
       Example: SRCMOS.EXE \path\file_name /c
     Where \path\file_name is the path and file name of BIOS Settings file to be
     created.


  (Capture options)
   [Secure data and Supervisor password]
     SRCMOS can capture BIOS secure data that includes a supervisor password.
     The captured data has an encrypted supervisor password of the donor
     ThinkPad. To capture the supervisor password, add the /kpap option to enter
     the password by the keyboard.
       Example: SRCMOS.EXE \path\file_name /c /kpap

     You must use the level of BIOS ID in the following table for this function.
     If you use a former level of BIOS ID, you must add the /e option when
     capturing donor BIOS settings. SRCMOS will not attempt to read secure data.
       Example: SRCMOS.EXE \path\file_name /c /e
     You have no need to use the /e option at the target ThinkPad computers.

   [UIA (User Information Area) Data]
     To save UIA data, add the /UIA option.
       Example: SRCMOS.EXE \path\file_name /c /UIA
     You have no need to use the /e option at the target ThinkPad computers.

   [Power-on password and Hard disk password]
     SRCMOS with some ThinkPad computers can deploy power-on password and hard
     disk password. To use this function, you must use the level of BIOS ID in
     the following table for this function. To set the power-on password and
     hard disk password at the target ThinkPad computers, create a password.txt
     file (any name), add the /EP password.txt options.
       Example: SRCMOS.EXE \path\file_name /c /EP password.txt
     Where password.txt contains the names of BIOS settings files for each of
     target ThinkPad computers, the power-on password and the hard disk password.
     "Sample.txt" shows the format of .csv file.

     If the supervisor password is set on a donor ThinkPad, add the /kpap option
     to enter the password by the keyboard.
       Example: SRCMOS.EXE \path\file_name /c /kpap /EP password.txt
     In this case, the BIOS Settings file contains a supervisor password.

     WARNING:
     This process creates an intermediate file that contains the power-on
     password, hard disk password and a pointer to the system that these
     passwords are intended to be installed on. Be sure to treat this
     intermediate file as a potential security exposure that exists until the
     reset process is complete. Be sure to transmit the file securely to the
     target system and to destroy the file when finished. Examples of secure
     transmission include carrying the file on removable media to the target
     system or encrypting the file before transmission over the network to the
     target system.


Playing Back BIOS Settings
--------------------------

  Do the following procedures at a target ThinkPad:

  (Starting playback)
  1. Copy the BIOS Settings file in the step 10 of the "Capturing BIOS Settings"
     section into the media in the step 7, as well.
  2. Insert the media in its device, then power on and boot the computer with
     the media.
  3. At the command line, execute SRCMOS.EXE with the /u option.
       Example: SRCMOS.EXE \path\file_name /u
     Where \path\file_name is the path and file name of BIOS Settings file.
  4. The computer restarts automatically. After restart, the computer will shut
     down automatically at ThinkPad logo screen.

  (Notes)
   [Secure data and Supervisor password]
     If the target computer already has a supervisor password, add the /kpap
     option to enter the supervisor password by keyboard:
       Example: SRCMOS.EXE \path\file_name /u /kpap
     You must use the level of BIOS ID in the following table for this function.

   [Power-on password and Hard disk password]
     If the target computer already has a power-on password and/or a hard disk
     password, you can not set the passwords by SRCMOS. You must remove the
     passwords by BIOS Setup Utility at the target computer.
     You must use the level of BIOS ID in the following table for this function.

HOW TO USE THE SOFTWARE WITH RDM

  The following information is a supplement of CMOS Update of Chapter 3. RDM
  Tasks in "Remote Deployment Manager 4.x Operations Guide" when CMOS update on
  ThinkPad using RDM is performed.


Creating a CMOS Settings Image (for ThinkPad system user)
---------------------------------------------------------

  1. At a donor workstation:
   1-1. Start up the workstation and access the BIOS Setup. (You can access this
        program by pressing F1 key during the power-on self-test (POST))
   1-2. Change and save the desired setting as required.
   1-3. Exit from the Easy-setup program and restart the workstation. Ensure
        that the workstation starts up and functions properly.

  2. Rename the SRCMOS.EXE.
     => 'SRCMOS' + 'xx' + '.EXE'
                    xx: BIOS identifier (two characters)

     How to get BIOS identifier:
   2-1. Start up the workstation and access the BIOS Setup.
   2-2. The following two characters 'XX' of BIOS Version is BIOS identifier.
          BIOS Version    0.00a (XXETnnWW)

  3. Use the SRCMOSxx.EXE program to save the current settings of the donor
     workstation to a file named with the .CMS extension.
   3-1. Copy SRCMOSxx.EXE into a bootable and read/write-able media with DOS or
        Windows 95/98 boot disk installed.
   3-2. Insert the media in its device, then power on and boot the workstation
        with the media.
   3-3. When the logo screen appears, press the Esc key. The screen mode will

             ThinkPad X201, X201i, X201s, X201 Tablet
             ThinkPad X300, X301
             ThinkPad G50
             ThinkPad R60, R60e, R61, R61e
             ThinkPad T60, T60p, T61, T61p
             ThinkPad X60, X60s, X60 Tablet, X61, X61s, X61 Tablet
             ThinkPad Z61e, Z61m, Z61p, Z61t
             ThinkPad Reserve Edition
   3-4. Execute the SRCMOSxx.exe with the correct parameters:
          > SRCMOSxx \path\file_name.CMS /c
        If the donor system has a supervisor password: (This option is not
        applicable for ThinkPad R31)
          > SRCMOSxx \path\file_name.cms /kpap
        A password prompt will appear. Type the correct supervisor password of
        donor workstation and press Enter.

        If you capture the data of the system that have supervisor password, the
        captured data have an encrypted supervisor password of the donor system.

  4. Create CMOS Update image on RDM server.

   [For RDM version 4.1 or newer]
   4-1. Prepare BIOS Update diskette or bootable CD for target system.
        (Note) For bootable CD, use CD-RW media.
   4-2. Copy SRCMOSxx.EXE into the BIOS diskette.
        (Note) For bootable CD, append SRCMOSxx.EXE to CD-RW.
   4-3. Create Firmware Flash image of the BIOS Update diskette. Using Image
        management menu from [Tasks] -> [Remote Deployment Manager].
   4-4. Copy CMOS setting file into appropriate folder(directory) on RDM server.
   4-5. Create CMOS setting image on RDM server.
        Using Image management menu from [Tasks] -> [Remote Deployment Manager].
        Select the CMOS setting file name in "Enter CMOS Clone file" field.

   [For RDM version 3.2 or earlier]
   4-1. Copy SRCMOSxx.EXE and .CMS file to the corresponding BIOS folder
        (directory) on your server which is named:
          C:\RDM_install_dir\BIOS\Flash_BIOS_Name
        where the 'Flash_BIOS_Name' folder(directory) is the name of the BIOS
        level on your donor workstation (unless this was changed by the system
        administrator during the Read BIOS Flash diskette process).
        (Note)
        When you are not able to get the BIOS update diskette when using RDM
        version 3.2 or earlier, you can store CMOS setting files and
        SRCMOSxx.EXE using the following steps.
        a. Check the "Current BIOS Level" of the Maintenance page of the
           Individual Client Details notebook.
        b. Create the folder (directory) under the \RDM_install_dir\BIOS which
           has the same name to "Current BIOS Level".
           For example, if "Current BIOS Level" is IBUJ01WW, the required folder
           (directory) is:
             \RDM_installed_dir\BIOS\IBUJ01WW
        c. Copy SRCMOSxx.EXE and .CMS file to above folder (directory).
        d. You must uncheck the "Update BIOS" check box of the Maintenance page.
           (Check the "Update CMOS with file" check box only.)


  From Ver. 3.11, SRCMOS can support:
  A) Distribution of supervisor password, and
  B) Distribute cmos data to the target systems that have supervisor password.
  To use these features, you must apply "RDM 3.1.01 Patch 1" to your RDM system.

  A) Distribute supervisor password from donor to targets
  If the donor system has a supervisor password, the captured data file (.cms
  file) from the system contain an encrypted supervisor password of the donor
  system.
  If you distribute this data by RDM, the supervisor password of the target
  systems will be updated.

  B) Distribute cmos data to the system that has supervisor password
  If the target system already has supervisor password, you must set the
  password to RDM Console pages:
  1. Open RDM main console.
  2. Select the target system from tree view and double-click.
  3. "Individual System Details" page should appear. Select the Maintenance tab.
  4. Enter the supervisor password in the "BIOS Admin Password" edit box.
  5. Uncheck the "Update BIOS Admin Password" checkbox.

  Note:
  ThinkPad systems do not support "Update BIOS Admin Password" on the RDM
  Console. ThinkPad systems only support "Distribute" the supervisor password
  from donor to target by .cms file.
