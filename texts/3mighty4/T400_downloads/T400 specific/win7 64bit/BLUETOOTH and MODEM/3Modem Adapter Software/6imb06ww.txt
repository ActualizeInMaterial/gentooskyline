Using Modem on Hold (MoH) and Fast Connect

Notes:
- To use these functions, you need a telephone line that has call waiting and
  caller ID function, which each country or region sets independently. You also
  have to Connect to an ISP access point that is compatible with these functions.
  Check with your ISP.

- The MoH function has been tested and shown to work in the United States and
  Canada. It may not work correctly in other countries.

- The Fast Connect function works well if you dial to the same phone number from
  only one place. Otherwise, it is better to disable the Fast Connect function.

- To use the Modem on Hold and Fast Connect function, you have to run the Modem
  on Hold application first and enable each function by the following procedures:
  1. Click Start, select All Programs, select NetWaiting, and click Netwaiting.
  2. Right-click the NetWaiting icon in the task tray and click Setting.
  3. Check the Modem on Hold setting and close it.
