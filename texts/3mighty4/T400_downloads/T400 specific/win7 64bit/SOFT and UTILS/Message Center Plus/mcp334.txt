WHAT THIS PACKAGE DOES

This package installs Message Center Plus, which alerts you when
conditions arise on your computer that require your attention.

Message Center Plus enables Lenovo to communicate important messages
to you across the internet.  Executing "invisibly" as a background task
each time you start your computer, Message Center Plus will
periodically scan a Lenovo server for new messages that are appropriate
for your system. When a message is available, Message Center Plus will
automatically download and display it in a popup window at the bottom
right corner of your desktop.  Message Center Plus does not display
any other application windows, and currently does not have any
configurable settings.  Hence, Message Center Plus does not create any
desktop or Start menu links, system notification area (tray) icon,
Control Panel applet, or any other Windows interface elements (except
for an uninstall item in Add/Remove Programs).

NOTE:  Message Center Plus never collects or transmits any information
about you or your computer.

Approximately 3.90 MB of space must be available on your hard drive to
download this package.  Message Center Plus requires approximately
2 MB to install.  If this package has been installed, updating
(overwrite-installing) this package will fix problems, add new
functions, or expand functions as noted below.
