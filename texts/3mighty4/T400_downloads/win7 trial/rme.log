computed on my T400(sysrescd, /tmp/ tmpfs):

second time later:

- but cpu was set to minimum in BIOS!!! which is apparently 1600Mhz(?) as reported by some sysrescd hardware reporting tool(it was lshw)
nope it's 800Mhz as reported by /proc/cpuinfo, also

Reset the evaluation timer

After 30 days of evaluation, you can reset the evaluation timer by opening the command prompt in admin mode, and typing in the command "slmgr -rearm". You can repeat this procedure up to 3 times, so your evaluation time will be 120 days altogether.
