What is this ?
--------------

- a bunch of customizations and work-in-progress scripts and patches on my linux system - others might still find bits and pieces of useful data, if even just for educational purposes; at least I know I would if I were them.
- expect the quality of anything inhere to be low and filled with bugs and unhandled cases, although I kinda strive to handle as many cases as possible otherwise that's how bugs get created.
- also keeping track of some things(like bugs/issues/caveats) in some text files 
- some dotfiles should also be here

License
-------

Any code and non-code created by me is licensed under the terms of UNLICENSE and/or CC0 (ie. public domain)
unless when this license cannot be applied due to incompatibility and requirement that the code/patch must be licensed under the same license than the code that I'm patching, then that license is considered to be applied also (ie. dual license) for that specific code/patch. (assuming that works, wtw! look, just do it, okay?!).  

Look, all I want is that whatever code I produce, be public domain, under UNLICENSE / CC0. Why is this so hard?! :P

Anything else that is not created by me is copyright(or may even be public domain already) by their respective authors. Reproduced here for reference only.

Please note that code created by me, as well as code taken from somewhere else, may not always be annotated as such.
