What is this ?
--------------

- a bunch of customizations and work-in-progress scripts and patches on my linux system - quite useless to anyone else 
- this is mainly for learning purposes; expect the quality of anything inhere to be quite low and filled with bugs and unhandled cases 
- also keeping track of some things(like bugs/issues/caveats) in some text files 
- some dotfiles should also be here
