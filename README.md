What is this ?
--------------

- a bunch of customizations and work-in-progress scripts and patches on my linux system - others might still find bits and pieces of useful data, if even just for educational purposes; at least I know I would if I were them.
- expect the quality of anything inhere to be low and filled with bugs and unhandled cases, although I kinda strive to handle as many cases as possible otherwise that's how bugs get created.
- also keeping track of some things(like bugs/issues/caveats) in some text files 
- some dotfiles should also be here
